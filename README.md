## TITLE: TANZANIA WATER WELL PUMP STATUS PREDICTION
### OVERVIEW
In Tanzania, the history of water supply has been a dynamic interplay of geographical, social, and economic factors. Initially blessed with abundant water resources, the country encountered challenges in distributing water efficiently. To address this, a proactive initiative has emerged. By analyzing historical data on pump functionality, geography, maintenance, and local demographics, this project aims to predict potential pump issues. Its goal is to create a scalable predictive tool aiding decision-makers. This tool not only optimizes resource allocation and maintenance but also engages communities. Through partnerships and qualitative data integration, it seeks to blend data-driven insights with community perspectives. Ultimately, this holistic approach aims to improve water infrastructure management sustainably while fostering community empowerment in Tanzania.

In Tanzania, water supply history intertwines geography, society, and economics. Despite abundant resources, efficient distribution posed challenges. Addressing this, a project analyzes pump data to predict issues, aiding decision-makers in resource allocation and maintenance. Beyond predictive analytics, it prioritizes community engagement, integrating qualitative data for a holistic, participatory approach to sustainable water infrastructure management.
## Challenges
In a developing country like Tanzania, ensuring clean and accessible piped water faces numerous challenges. Some of these challenges include:
#
1.`Infrastructure Deficiency`: Many areas lack the necessary infrastructure for piped water systems. Remote or rural areas might not have pipelines or water treatment facilities, making it difficult to distribute clean water to these regions.
#
2.`Limited Access to Technology`: Developing countries may face limitations in accessing advanced technology for water treatment and distribution.
#
3.`Financial Constraints`: Funding constraints often limit the government's ability to invest in water infrastructure and maintenance.
#
4.`Population Growth`: Rapid population growth strains existing water resources and infrastructure. As urbanization increases, the demand for water rises, putting pressure on already limited water sources and distribution systems.
#
5 `Poor Maintenance`: Existing water infrastructure might suffer from poor maintenance due to a lack of resources or skilled personnel.
## Proposed solutions
1.Build a predictive machine learning model that predicts whether a pump is functional , not functional or functioning but needs repair in orde to reduce water shortage due to failure of pumps
#
2.Identify features or properties that lead to these water related problems and adress them
#
3.Identify regions that suffer most from these challenges so we can have a map or ways on how to improve their status.
#
4.Investigate whether the infrastructure available is enough to meet the people's need 
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
The provision of clean and sustainable water access remains a critical challenge in Tanzania, with a vast network of water pumps serving communities across the country. However, the operational status of these pumps fluctuates, leading to intermittent water supply and hindering communities' access to safe drinking water. This project addresses the pressing need to develop a robust machine learning classification model capable of accurately predicting the operational status of water pumps in Tanzania.
#
The project scope focuses on harnessing historical data encompassing pump functionality, geographical features, maintenance records, and regional demographics to train and validate a predictive model. The objective is to accurately classify water pumps into different status categories, including 'functional,' 'functional needs repair,' and 'non-functional.' A successful model will enable stakeholders and decision-makers to anticipate potential pump failures or maintenance requirements proactively, thus optimizing resource allocation, reducing downtime, and ensuring sustained water access for Tanzanian communities.
# GOALS AND OBJECTIVE
General objective;
The main objective is to build and train a machine learning model to help us predict if water pumps installed in water points are functioning, not functional or working but needs repair.
Specific objectives
#
Use exploratory analysis to visually understand and understand what the data is communicating and also try to understand relationship between our data columns
